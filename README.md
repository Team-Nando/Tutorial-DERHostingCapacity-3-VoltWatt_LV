# Tutorial on DER Hosting Capacity - Part 3: Volt-Watt Control and PV Hosting Capacity of LV Networks

## Tutorial on DER Hosting Capacity

This multi-part Tutorial on Distributed Energy Resource (DER) Hosting Capacity will guide you, using interactive code via Jupyter Notebook and Python, through the different steps to run advanced, detailed time-series simulations to properly assess the technical impacts of DERs (such as solar photovoltaics ‚òÄÔ∏èüè°) on realistic three-phase unbalanced distribution networks.

This Tutorial is designed for power engineering students (undergraduate and postgraduate), power engineers, researchers, consultants, etc. It requires some knowledge of coding (of course! ü§ì) but not too advanced. If you are a decent coder, you will manage üòâ.

## Part 3: Volt-Watt Control and PV Hosting Capacity of LV Networks

The objectives of this tutorial are:
1. To familiarise with the process by which power engineers can **assess the effects of the Volt-Watt control function (available in most residential PV inverters and used by most standards around the world) on voltages and, thus, on PV hosting capacity**.

2. To continue familiarising with **advanced tools** useful to run distribution network studies involving DERs. You will continue using [OpenDSS](https://www.epri.com/pages/sa/opendss) via the [dss_python](https://github.com/dss-extensions/dss_python) module. And, to guide you, all will be done using a notebook on [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

## Run Part 3
To make the most of Part 3, you should have completed [Part 2](https://github.com/Team-Nando/Tutorial-DERHostingCapacity-2-TimeSeries_LV) and, of course, be familiar with [OpenDSS for Beginners and the modelling of distribution networks and DERs](https://sites.google.com/view/luisfochoa/research-tools).  

Choose one of the options below to run Part 3.

### Cloud Option ‚òÅÔ∏è: Google Colab
Just click on the badge <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/Team-Nando/Tutorial-DERHostingCapacity-3-VoltWatt_LV/blob/main/Tutorial-DERHC-3.ipynb"> <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg"/></a>. You don't need to install anything ü§ìüí™.

### Local Option üíª: Jupyter Notebook
Make sure you have installed Anaconda, the dss_python module, etc. as specified in [Part 0](https://github.com/Team-Nando/Tutorial-DERHostingCapacity-0-dss_python). Otherwise, you will not be able to go through the tutorial. To guarantee that you have all the necessary packages you can also run the  **`requirements.txt`** file using  **`pip install -r requirements.txt`** on the Anaconda prompt.

1. Download all the files using the green **`<> Code`** button at the top right.
   - You will get a ZIP file with a folder that contains all the files.
   - Unzip the file an place the folder somewhere in your computer/laptop.
2. To open the Jupyter notebook file (extension **`ipynb`**) you need to:
   - Open Anaconda Navigator
   - Click on Launch Jupyter notebook (it will open in your browser)
   - Upload the unzipped folder (with all the corresponding files) to Jupyter Notebook (the location is up to you)
   - Go inside the folder and open the **`ipynb`** file

All the tutorial instructions will be in the **`ipynb`** file.
