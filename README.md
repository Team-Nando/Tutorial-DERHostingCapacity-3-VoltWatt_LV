# ELEN90077 2023 Workshop - Week 3 "PV Hosting Capacity and Volt-Watt Control"

This ELEN90077 2023 workshop will be developed in week 3.

The objectives of this workshop are:
1. To familiarise with the process by which power engineers can assess the effects of the Volt-Watt control function (available in most residential PV inverters and used by most standards around the world) on voltages and, thus, on PV hosting capacity.

2. To continue familiarising with the advanced tool [OpenDSS](https://www.epri.com/pages/sa/opendss) (using Python and the [dss_python](https://github.com/dss-extensions/dss_python) module module). And, to guide you, all will be done using a notebook on [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

All the instructions on how to download the files and install all the necessary tools to perform this workshop are included on Canvas. Make sure you have installed Anaconda, the dss_python module, etc. as specified on Canvas. Otherwise, you will not be able to go through the workshop.

1. Download all the files using the green **`<> Code`** button at the top right.
   - You will get a ZIP file with a folder that contains all the files.
   - Unzip the file an place the folder somewhere in your computer/laptop.
3. To open the Jupyter notebook file (extension **`ipynb`**) you need to:
   - Open Anaconda Navigator
   - Click on Launch Jupyter notebook (it will open in your browser)
   - Upload the unzipped folder (with all the corresponding files) to Jupyter Notebook (the location is up to you)
   - Go inside the folder and open the **`ipynb`** file

All the workshop instructions will be in the **`ipynb`** file.

Enjoy!
